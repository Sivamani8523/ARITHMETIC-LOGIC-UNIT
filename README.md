To design and simulate a basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) capable of performing fundamental arithmetic and logic operations using Verilog HDL, with testbench verification and output analysis.ChatGPT (for design guidance and Verilog code generation) Verilog HDLModelSim / Vivado / any other simulation tool (specify which you used)Testbench for simulationThe ALU is a combinational digital circuit designed to perform a set of arithmetic and logic operations on binary inputs. The module accepts two 8-bit input operands (A and B) and a 3-bit control signal (ALU_Sel) to select the operation.
